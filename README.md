# wids-datathon-2020
The WiDS Datathon aims to inspire women worldwide to learn more about data science, and to create a supportive environment for women to connect with others in their community who share their interests. Toward these ends, we open the datathon to individuals or teams of up to 4; at least half of each team must be women (individuals identifying as female participants). Participants can include students, faculty, and individuals with various roles in non-profit, academic, government, and industry organizations.
